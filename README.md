Diabities prdiction through Machine Learning

Diabetes Classification Using Machine Learning Diabetes classification involves predicting whether an individual has diabetes based on various medical attributes. This process is vital for early diagnosis and management, ultimately helping in reducing the health risks associated with diabetes. The classification model utilizes attributes such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the outcome (presence or absence of diabetes).
