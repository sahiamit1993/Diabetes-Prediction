**Title:** Sample Machine Learning Submission Template (Python)

**Description:**

This repository provides a sample Jupyter Notebook template for machine learning projects using Python. The template guides you through essential steps like data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

**Features:**

* Structured approach for machine learning project development.
* Clear organization of data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation stages.
* Helpful comments and explanations within the notebook cells.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahiamit1993/Diabetes-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   The specific dependencies will depend on the libraries used in the notebook. You can usually find them listed in the notebook itself or in a `requirements.txt` file. Install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the notebook:**

   Use a Jupyter Notebook environment to open `Copy_of_Sample_ML_Submission_Template (2).ipynb`.

**Customize the Template:**

* Replace the placeholder dataset used in the notebook with your own data.
* Adapt the preprocessing steps to fit your data's specific needs.
* Choose and implement a machine learning model suitable for your problem.
* Modify the evaluation metrics to align with your project goals.

**Note:**

* This template serves as a starting point for your machine learning projects.
* Feel free to modify and extend the notebook according to your specific requirements.
